      <TextArea editable="false" prefHeight="570.0" prefWidth="900.0" text="Hello User!&#10;&#10;We hope that you are enjoying your WineWise experience so far, if your'e stuck with a particular feature, refer to the headers below for an explanation on how they work.&#10;&#10;Navigation Bar:&#10;---------------&#10;At the top of the application you will see some icons to help you navigate WineWise. Going left to right, these are the search page, the maps page, the help page (you are here!), and the admin sign in page, you don't need to worry about that. The WineWise logo in the middle will take you to the home page.&#10;&#10;Home Page:&#10;----------&#10;Here you can view the top rated wines across the application, as you hover over a wine, you can see that the border around it turns bold, this means that the wine can be selected and a double click will open up the further details of the wine. Refer to the section below on the wine popup for navigating this popup. At the bottom of the home page, you will notice some arrows, these will let you switch pages between the wines in WineWise. Remember, whenever you feel, double click a wine for further details.&#10;&#10;Search Page:&#10;------------&#10;Here you can search through the WineWise database to find the perfect wine for you. In the middle of this page you will see a table full of all the wines. If you want to sort this table by an attribute, click the header of the column, and you can choose whether or not you want the search from top to bottom, or bottom to top. If you don't want this sorting anymore, just the reset button in the bottom left. &#10;&#10;Speaking of the left, you will see a sidebar with some filter options. Here you can filter by category, critic score, vintage, region, or winery. For the drop down menus once you click them you will see all the possible options from the WineWise database. In the critic scores menu, you will be able to type in which scores you want to filter by. Once you're done with selecting your filters, go ahead and click the apply button and watch your dream wines appear right in front of you eyes! If there's a particular wine that's stuck in your head, type some keywords into the search bar at the top of the page and click the search button, this will bring up all wines matching those keywords. If you want to further filter that list, the sidebar on the left will also work, just go ahead and click apply once you select your filters.&#10;&#10;Just like the home page, if there's a wine you like the look of, go ahead and double click it and it will open up a popup with further details of the wine.&#10;&#10;Maps Page:&#10;----------&#10;If you're curious about the location of a winery, head to the maps page! Here you can browse all wineries that are shown in the application. When you select a winery on the left, all wines produced by that winery will appear on the right. You can also click those wines for a wine popup.&#10;&#10;Help Page:&#10;----------&#10;You're already here, silly! Click another icon in the navigation bar if you've had enough.&#10;&#10;Admin Page:&#10;-----------&#10;Full of mysterious secrets that you don't need to worry about, go ahead and close that popup if you get curious.&#10;&#10;Wine Popup Navigation Bar:&#10;--------------------------&#10;Once you double click a wine from either the home page or the search page, a popup will appear. The navigation bar at the top contains further details of the wine, user reviews of the wine, and a spot for you to leave your own review! Click the close button in the top right if you're done with this wine.&#10;&#10;Wine Popup Details:&#10;-------------------&#10;This screen contains details of the wine, like the wine name, description, rating, winery, region, and vintage. Additionally, in the bottom right you will be able to see some suggested wines based on the wine you've just selected. These wines are the highest critic scoring wines with a matching colour, vintage, or winery with your selected wine. You can click on these wines to view the further details of them if you would like! Feel free to open up a couple of popups to compare your wines.&#10;&#10;Wine Popup Reviews:&#10;-------------------&#10;At the top of this screen you'll be able to see the wine you're currently viewing. Below that will be a table of reviews that users have left on this wine. These are users from the very same kiosk as you! If you can't see the whole review, give it a click and it will load into the box below. From there you can see the whole review. As much as we try to foster a positive environment in WineWise, if a hooligan leaves an inappropriate review, click the check box to the right of it, and it will send it through to the admin who can decide the fate of the review. If you accidently check this box don't worry, you need to leave the screen before it gets sent through, so you can simply uncheck the box.&#10;&#10;Wine Popup Leave a Review:&#10;--------------------------&#10;I'm sure you had so much fun browsing other user reviews, that you're just dying to leave your'e own! In case you forgot, the wine you're currently viewing is still saved at the top of the screen. Below that is a rating slider, where you can give the wine a score. Below the rating slider, is a text box to explain your rating. You get 500 characters, so go crazy! If you're not the literary type, you can still leave a review with just a rating. Once you're all done, click the save review button and you'll be able to see your freshly minted review on the reviews page of this wine. If you don't like what you've written, just click the reset review button so clear your review. &#10;&#10;" wrapText="true" />
